### Motivation ###
The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. It is the foundation of the US$166B Big Data ecosystem (source: IDC) by enabling data applications to run and be managed on large hardware clusters in a distributed computing environment. Besides, it has been at the center of this big data transformation, providing an ecosystem with tools for businesses to store and process data on a scale that was unheard of several years ago.

### Practice: ###

#### Before you begin ####
(It is assumed that Git is already installed and working).

#### Exercices ####

1. ETL: Movies data processing

Process the 5000 films data file extracted from IMDB and answer the questions below. Show obtained results in a simple HTML document. Additionaly, add the time that takes to process the data to achieve requirements.

- ¿How many "colour" films and how many "black and white" films are there in the list?
- ¿How many films did each director produce?
- ¿Which are the 10 least criticized films?
- ¿Which are the 20 longest films?
- ¿Which are the 5 films which raised the most money?
- ¿Which are the 5 fils which raised the least money?
- ¿Which are the 3 movies which spent the most to be produced?
- ¿Which are the 3 movies which spent the least to be produced?
- ¿In which year were more films released?
- ¿In which year were less films released?
- Create a ranking of actors including the following:
  - amount of movies where the actor performed
  - his/her influence in social networks
  - his/her best movie
  - ordered by number of performances

- Create a tag cloud using movies tags or keywords. To do this, is enough with creating and showing a word ranking and its weight (number of appareances of the word), with descending order.

- ¿Which movie gender raised the most for each year?
- ¿Which movie gender raised the least for each year?
- Show the actors ranking ordered by performances and popularity
- ¿Which movie genre do people like the most?
- ¿Which are the 5 directors with the best reputation?

Do not use the pandas package to make this implementation. Restrict to the Standard Library.
